This notebook implements a solution to a partial differential equation from an application in petroleum engineering, and re-uses the method defined for the partial differential equation to solve an ordinary differential equation.

The plots show the solution of the differential equations and the corresponding input signal, as well as 3D surface plots for the PDE.

Simulations of physical systems like this are used in Petroleum Engineering to mitigate safety risks during oil drilling.
